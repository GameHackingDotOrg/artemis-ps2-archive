The LDv4Joker.txt is for auto loading joker addresses on boot. That way you can get around the freezing problem with the joker scanner. The switch is in the Options menu.
When you boot uLE, you have the option to load a pre-set joker (if auto load joker is on) based on the discs elf. In case you have plans to use another booting method.

Controls:
	Start: Launchs uLaunchELF (mc0:/BOOT/BOOT.ELF, mc1:/BOOT/BOOT.ELF, mass:/BOOT/BOOT.ELF).
	Select: Launchs OSDSYS

The rest is pretty straight forward.
