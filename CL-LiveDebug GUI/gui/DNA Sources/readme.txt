Most of these were made with Photoshop CS6; the ones with the .pdn extension were made with a free program called Paint.NET.

The Staff of Artemis was a quick reproduction of the one in the original logo.png. So this one is bigger/higher quality.
Oh the shadow on the staff was done with PS CS6 since Paint.NET doesn't have a shadow option by default.

Font used for desc_object is MonaKo, and the main font is Neuropol.
