DESCRIPTION

lsmod shows what IOP modules and libraries are currently loaded and provides
information about their states.

Its main goal is to find out more about the innards of commercial PS2 games.
It is, for example, possible to direct lsmod's output to a text file on memory
card while running a game.


USAGE

Simply call SifLoadModule() or use ps2client to run lsmod.

Without an argument, lsmod prints its output to stdout and the file mc0:modlist.

$ ps2client -t 1 execiop host:lsmod.irx

If necessary, you can specify a different output file as an argument, e.g.:

$ ps2client -t 1 execiop host:lsmod.irx host:modlist

A more sophisticated approach is required if you want to use lsmod with games.
I recommend calling the game's SifLoadModule() function from your code.  Keep in
mind that the right modules have to be loaded before accessing mc0.  So you
should probably load lsmod _after_ the game has loaded its native modules.
