DESCRIPTION

dump2mass is a simple application that allows you to dump memory to an USB flash
drive attached to your PS2 console.

It is primarily a solution for Project Artemis' BountySource task #2267:
https://artemis.bountysource.com/task/show/2267

The solution's page can be found here:
https://artemis.bountysource.com/solution/show/1074

Be aware that the write speed is very slow.

dump2mass was tested with:
- PS2 console SCPH-90004 CB
- FreeUsbd v0.1.2
- usb_mass v0.40 wr
- Hama FlashPen 1GB (FAT16/32)


USAGE

Make sure that there's a FAT16 or FAT32 formatted USB flash drive connected to
your PS2.

Use ps2client to run dump2mass. Specify the name of the memory region(s) to dump
as argument(s).  Valid region names are "ram", "rom0", or "iop".  See source
code for the complete list.

$ ps2client execee host:dump2mass.elf <region1> <region2> <...>

Finally, memory should be dumped to one or more files on the USB drive.
