Artemis Commit Policy
written by misfire <misfire@xploderfreax.de>


HUGE NOTE: This document is obsolete. All future development of Artemis will
take place at http://bitbucket.org/misfire/artemis/



Stable trunk strategy
---------------------

As we follow the stable trunk strategy, direct changes MUST NOT be made to the
SVN trunk of this project, that is, trunk/artemis/.

Development may only take place in the development branch(es). If new features,
bug fixes, etc. turn out to be stable, they'll be merged to the trunk later on.


artemis-next
------------

branch/artemis-next is the main development branch. It is supposed to contain
the latest cutting-edge code of the project.

I'm the maintainer of artemis-next and take responsibility for it. If you have
anything to contribute, don't hesitate to send me patches via email.


More branches
-------------

Of course, we can add more branches if need be. For example, I can think of an
artemis-gui branch where the GUI people to their work without affecting the rest
of the team.


Licensing
---------

Artemis is written and distributed under the GNU General Public License which
means that its source code is freely-distributed and available to the general
public.

You may only contribute to Artemis if you agree with the terms of the GPL.
