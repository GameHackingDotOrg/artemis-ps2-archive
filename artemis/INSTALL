To build the PS2 part of Artemis, you need a working PS2DEV toolchain with an
up-to-date version of the PS2SDK.

[PATCHES]
Currently, it is required to patch the PS2SDK sources with the file
patches/ps2sdk-erl-fix.patch and rebuild it from scratch. That will hopefully
change soon when the patch is directly included in the SDK.
[/PATCHES]

First, you have to install the PS2 ports of libconfig and libcheats to the SDK,
most likely under /usr/local/ps2dev/ps2sdk/ports/. Both can be compiled and
installed just by running two commands in the respective project folder:

$ cd ee/libconfig/
$ make -f Makefile.PS2
# make -f Makefile.PS2 install

$ cd common/libcheats/
$ make -f Makefile.PS2
# make -f Makefile.PS2 install

Now, go to the project's root directory to finally build the Artemis executable:

$ make rebuild

This will create ee/loader/artemis.elf.

Currently, it is recommended to run the ELF with ps2link (you need the high-
loading version!) and ps2client:

$ cd ee/loader/
$ make run

If you want to boot it from mass, memory card, etc., make sure that artemis.conf
is placed in the same folder as the ELF.
