To build the PS2 part of Artemis, you need a working PS2DEV toolchain with an
up-to-date version of the PS2SDK.

Also, you have to install the PS2 ports of libconfig and libcheats to the SDK,
most likely under /usr/local/ps2dev/ps2sdk/ports/. Both can be compiled and
installed just by running two commands in the respective project folder:

$ cd ee/libconfig/
$ make -f Makefile.PS2
# make -f Makefile.PS2 install

$ cd common/libcheats/
$ make -f Makefile.PS2
# make -f Makefile.PS2 install

Afterwards, you can finally build the Artemis executable:

$ cd ee/loader/
$ make

This will create ee/loader/artemis.elf.

Currently, it is recommended to run the ELF with ps2link + ps2client:

$ make run
