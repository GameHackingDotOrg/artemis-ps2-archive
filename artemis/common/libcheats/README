Welcome to libcheats! This library allows you to read, manipulate, and write
cheat codes in text format.

   About libcheats
---===============---

libcheats is a library that can read, manipulate, and write cheat codes in text
format. The format is quite simple:

"Game title 1"
Cheat description 1
Cheat code 1
Cheat code 2
Cheat description 2
Cheat code 1
Cheat code 2
"Game title 2"
etc.

Also, two types of comments are allowed in the cheats file:
- Script-style comments. All text beginning with a ‘#’ character to the end of
  the line is ignored.
- C++-style comments. All text beginning with a ‘//’ sequence to the end of the
  line is ignored.

Although libcheats is quite generic, the current version expects one code line
to be two 32-bit words. Therefore, you can only use it for systems like the PS2.
Without this size limitation, I hope that libcheats will someday become a standard
library when it comes to cheat code parsing/processing.

   Build
---=====---

To compile libcheats, you need CMake and a C compiler like gcc.
I recommend doing an out-of-source build:
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make

To install libcheats:
# make install

   Usage
