About Artemis
-------------

Artemis comprises of two parts:

1) Cheat System

Artemis is a cheat system which will have all the features people are used to.

The current version already allows you to load cheat codes from a text file and
to automatically activate them for the inserted game. Take a look at
doc/code_types.txt for a complete list of available code types.

2) Hacking System

Artemis' killer feature is the ability to hack/debug commercial PS2 games over
Ethernet using a PC-side debugger client like ps2cc by Viper187.

There're still a lot of games you can't hack with Artemis, but we're working
hard on improving compatibility.


More specific documentation can be found in the "doc" directory.
