About Artemis
-------------

Artemis comprises of two parts:

1) Cheat System

Artemis is a cheat system which will have all the features people are used to.

The current version already allows you to load cheat codes from a text file and
to automatically activate them for the inserted game. Take a look at
doc/code_types.txt for a complete list of available code types.

2) Hacking System

Artemis' killer feature will be the ability to hack/debug commercial PS2 games
over Ethernet using a PC-side debugger client.

Although we already have the technology to hack many games (thanks to
jimmikaelkael's Core Launcher), this feature has not been merged yet.


More specific documentation can be found in the "doc" directory.
