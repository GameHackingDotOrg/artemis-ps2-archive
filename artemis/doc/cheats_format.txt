Artemis makes use of the libcheats library to read cheat codes in text format.

The format of the text file is quite simple:

"Game title 1 /ID NAME"
Cheat description 1
Cheat code 1
Cheat code 2
Cheat description 2
Cheat code 1
Cheat code 2

"Game title 2 /ID NAME"
etc.

The ID is used by the cheat system to auto-detect the inserted game and activate
codes accordingly. NAME must be the name of the game's start ELF (as specified
in SYSTEM.CNF but w/o directory suffix).
Note that the game ID handling will be improved in the future.

Also, two types of comments are allowed in the cheats file:
- Script-style comments. All text beginning with a ‘#’ character to the end of
  the line is ignored.
- C++-style comments. All text beginning with a ‘//’ sequence to the end of the
  line is ignored.

Sample:

"TimeSplitters PAL /ID SLES_500.78"
// some senseless comment
Mastercode

Invincible
