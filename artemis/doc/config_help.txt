Artemis uses libconfig to read and store its configuration:
http://www.hyperrealm.com/libconfig/libconfig_manual.html

The config file is named artemis.conf and must be in Artemis' root folder.

Here is a list of the available settings:


Section "loader"
----------------

* iop_reset [bool, false by default]

  Set 'iop_reset' to true to reset the IOP on startup.

* sbv_patches [bool, true by default]

  Set it to true to apply all SBV patches on startup:
   - sbv_patch_enable_lmb
   - sbv_patch_disable_prefix_check
   - sbv_patch_user_mem_clear


Section "engine"
----------------

* addr [32-bit offset, 0x00080000 by default]

  Specifies the load address of the cheat engine. This address must belong
  to user space memory (0x00080000-0x01ffffff).

* file [path, not set by default]

  If you don't want to use the built-in cheat engine, you can specify the
  filename of an external engine instead.


Section "cheats"
----------------

* file [path, cheats.txt by default]

  Set 'file' to the name of the cheats file to use.
