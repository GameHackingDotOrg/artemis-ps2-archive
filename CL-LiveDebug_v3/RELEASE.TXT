Some functionality borrowed from other sources.

Source version: 3.0.4


If you use some of this source for your own application please provide proper credit.
I already know that by releasing this source that 'sp0nge', 'freddyftbll', 'n.injallo',
and the rest of them credit and source stealing idiots at 'cheatersevolved' will take
this and claim they made it / a debugger on their own. Please keep in mind that those
idiots only steal sources and credit, and actually contain no ability at software
development nor hacking (any form of code hacking console hacking etc.). However
I am still releasing this source to help out those who wish to learn / play with the
ability to force GPU print outs during gameplay.
