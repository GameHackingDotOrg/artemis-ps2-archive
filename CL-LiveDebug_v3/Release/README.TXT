Loading instructions:
Insert your game disc into the PlayStation 2 console, then launch the Debugger's .ELF from any boot loader.


This program was developed to allow in-game memory viewing / editing and applying codes during game.


Enter debugger: R3 + L3 (Press at the same time)


When you create a patch, the application preserves the original data of the memory address so you can later
turn the patch "on" and "off" from the patches menu. This enables better debugging for codes created under
the application. The application currently is not finished, so some of the features may be unavailable at
this current moment. Most of the menus will display the controls on screen, for the ones that don't you can
always refer to this file for the controls.

This version has a fail-safe mode implemented into it to prevent the game from locking up when you enter the
debugger. The fail-safe mode is displayed when you enter the keys to start the debugger. It provides on-screen
instructions to enter the main menu. The reason it was implemented was due to the issue of the IOP shutting off
the controller when you first enter the debugger. If it shuts it off, then you will be unable to access anything
in the debugger (including return to game). So the fail-safe mode will give you approximately 5 seconds to enter
the debugger, if you are unable to (the IOP shut off the controller) then it will automatically return to the game
so the controller can be turned back on.

You can pre-load patches before you launch the game from a memory card or USB drive. The patches must be in
a text document named "LDv3Patches.txt", and present on the root of the drive (mc0:/ mc1:/ mass:/) for loading.
Your patches file must follow the following format:

code name or description (15 character limit)
CAAAAAAA OOOOOOOO FFFFFFFF (C: Command; A: Address; O: DataON; F: DataOFF)
{blank line}
code name or description (15 character limit)
CAAAAAAA OOOOOOOO FFFFFFFF (C: Command; A: Address; O: DataON; F: DataOFF)
{blank line}
code name or description (15 character limit)
CAAAAAAA OOOOOOOO FFFFFFFF (C: Command; A: Address; O: DataON; F: DataOFF)
{blank line}

You can have up to 512 patches to pre-load, if you have more only the first 512 will be used. Each patch (or code)
must be single line patches. An example patches file is included in RAR file you downloaded.
