Dnawrkshp's contributions to CL-LiveDebug:

Bug fixes:

- Uses uLE's SYSTEM.CNF parser. Just more reliable.

- Now tries to boot uLE if booting from disc fails (purple screen)

- Fixed a TON of compiler warnings. There are now 0 :D.

- Fixed immense lag when reading at least 4 words worth of bytes that are greater than 0x7F. The drawString function had trouble printing those so I replaced them in a function with 0x01 (which shows a square).

- Fixed a bug that causes you to freeze when you open the memory browser (from the results menu) to an address that doesn't end with 0, 4, 8, or C. Now it opens to the closest lowest increment of 4 (example: D = C, 3 = 0, 6 = 4).

- No longer randomly freezes when booting a game. I didn't know to DI when entering kernel mode and EI after exiting kernel mode.

What's new:

6/13/13: 4.1.1 Unofficial

- Added ability to change the joker combo to enter the debugger

- Added a found jokers list at the main menu of the debugger

- Added ver option to the preset joker list. If you do not enter one it will not check for the number

4/02/13: 4.1.0 Beta

- Added dynamic allocation for both the register dumper and the packet

- Removed Gtlcpimp's exception handler

- Added ability to add preset joker from the GUI

- Added a keyboard to the GUI

- Added ability to set boot path to uLE from the GUI

- When booting SifLoadElf is attempted before trying to load and boot the elf itself

3/25/13: 4.0.1 Beta

- Added Gtlcpimp's Exception Handler

- Added joker address for Ty the Tasmanian Tiger

- Added Process Register Dumper

- Added offset option for AddToCodes menu. Since the patches system only stores 32 bit value, you must set whether you want an 8/16/32 bit value. But if you do a 8 or 16 bit value, then there may be an offset from the original address. So the offset allows you to add to the the original address. If the offset is not compatible with the bit selected, the address will be unmodified.

- Added jokers for Need For Speed Carbon NTSC and Need For Speed: Most Wanted NTSC U/C (Greatest Hits)

- Added spacing for font created by PS2FontCreator (which means the spacing has been created using math and not my eye)

- Added a program called PS2FontCreator made by Dnawrkshp and ORCXodus

3/10/13: 4.0.0 Beta

- Finished BETA GUI

- Added pre-set jokers option, look at LDJokers.txt for correct format

- Added boot uLaunchELF option

12/15/12: Mod Update

- Applied spacing for individual characters. The strings look a lot nicer. A new argument is now passed to _drawString as register t6. If you want a constant spacing between characters, set t6 equal to that space. Otherwise, set t6 equal to zero and it will use my non-constant spacing system.

12/12/12: Update

- Implemented searching for changed values and searching for unchanged values (next search only). Only works with 8, 16, and 32 bit change/unchange searches)

- Implemented Add to patch to Codes menu

- Implemented delete code from Codes menu

- Optimized the cheat engine so that it doesn't run through all 512 possible codes. It now stops looping through the codes when it hits an address of 0. This, as far as I know, means there are no more valid codes after it.


12/09/12: Update

- Implemented a 'Next Search' function that I give Gtlcpimp 98% credit because I copy pasted his search function and made it search through the results instead of the memory.

- Implemented search operators. Now you can search for Equal to (=), Not Equal to (!=), Less Than (<), Greater Than (>), Less Than or Equal to (<=), Greater Than or Equal to (>=).

- The Start, Stop, Value, and Operator values don't reset when you leave then menu. Press the Start button to reset them.

- The Select button (when in the search menu) will put you at the last possible marker. For instance, on the Value there are 32 marker places. Annoyingly you have to press you right button 31 times to get to the last one. Pressing Select will do that for you. Works with Start, Stop, and Value.

- Implemented ASCII window in the memory browser. The character corresponds to the byte, so you have to read backwards. I can change it if that is more desirable.

- Implemented live ASCII window in memory browser when editing a value

Enjoy!
