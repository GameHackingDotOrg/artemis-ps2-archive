All the CodeDesigner exports... Really quite messy but whatever.

PS2FontCreator is a program written in VB6 by ORCXodus and yours truly. Although not finished, it's very good at what it does.
At some point I may add an option to export in Gtlcpimp's compressed font version. Which pretty much converts the font in binary.
