I obtained these sounds from http://opengameart.org/content/ui-sound-effects-pack.

The sounds in this project were created by David McKee (ViRiX) soundcloud.com/virix


I am not going to use these sounds. I find them annoying if I hear them too often.
If anyone wants to, they can go ahead and replace these with one of their own.
Just link to the place you obtained the sounds (if you didn't create it yourself) in this readme.

I also haven't properly implemented sound... So these serve absolutely no purpose.
