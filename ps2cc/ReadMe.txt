PS2CC ReadMe and Changelog (or a half-assed attempt at one)
*****************************************************************************/
Yeah, this is shitty and will hopefully get improved on later. I just wanted 
to note a few things.

/****************************************************************************
Changes
*****************************************************************************/
Rev 15: Added Page Up/Down functionality on the results display. Note that this 
	shifts the actual page, as opposed to scroling the box, so set your page 
	sizes as desired.

Rev 14: 'I Fogot' search type was reporting 0 results. Luckily, it just seemed to 
	be a lack of the count itself being copied over.

/****************************************************************************
Keyboard Shortcuts and little known features (ones that I remember)
*****************************************************************************/
Page Up/Down: Advance the results page (the # in the combo box) up or down.

Select Result Value/Quick Activate Result: You probably noticed that clicking a 
	result copies the address and value to the input boxes for testing. What 
	you might not have noticed is that the value copied is dependant on which
	column you click in. Also, doublclicking the value will add that result
	straight to the active codes list with that value.
