AGUI v1.0 [04-26-09] - by Lazy Bastard

This is a skeleton GUI for Artemis. Menu items can be selected by using the directional pad, and rollover is implemented (if you select the top item in a row, then press UP, the bottom item in that row will then be selected, etc). Press X to accept a menu item, and press Triangle to step back one level. If X doesn't do anything, it's because whatever that item is hasn't been implemented yet  :p



INSTRUCTIONS:

Run just like any other ELF, but don't forget to copy both agui.elf AND freepad.irx from "bin" to your desired boot media - disc, memory card, USB flash, etc (depending on the version of your PS2, you may be able to get away with not including freepad.irx, but for consistency, and to avoid errors, you may as well include it).



CREDITS:

Many thanks to those below:

DreamTime (Tony Saveski) wrote the original G2 graphics library (which I've modified, updating dependencies and such so that it would compile with the current toolchain, and touched up here and there for proper compatibility with other libs).

PS2Dragon created the splash screen (which is our logo online, as well).

PL0 created the background image, which is called, simply, "Abstract Background", and can (at the time of writing), be found here: http://pl0.deviantart.com/art/Abstract-Wallpaper-51032055

And anyone else that's ever helped me in any way, of whom there are many :)
