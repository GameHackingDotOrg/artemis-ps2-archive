Firstly we find where all the systemcall function poiters are located.

We pick a system call that will be called ingame (near startup) i used AddIntcHandler (0x10).

We write a jal to our cheat engine(in kernel memory)on the address that holds the pointer to
the actual AddIntcHandler function, and then take the actual pointer, create a jal with it
and place this jal at the end of our code so the AddIntcHandler function is still called.

We run the game and because our code is in kernel memory it is not cleared!! Then once the
game calls AddIntcHandler it saves a jal to our function that writes the cheats on a
function that is called regularly (padread!!) so that the codes are always writen. We take
the origional opp code we replaced and place it at the end of our cheat writing function
so it doesnt throw any errors.

And thats it, very simple hardcoding mastercode cheat device. Look out for my tutorial on 
thread system master codes which in the progress i dissasemble codebreaker 9.2 :)

Cheers!
